   - 🔴 **Red "Demo Mode"** = Using dummy data only

### Step 2: Use the Setup Validator
1. Click the **"Setup Validator"** button in your app
2. Run all tests to verify:
   - Environment variables configured
   - Database connection working
   - All required tables exist
   - Authentication system ready
   - Sample data available

### Step 3: Test Real Data Operations

**Test User Registration:**
1. Go to login page
2. Enter phone: `+1 (555) 123-4567`
3. Enter OTP: `123456`
4. Complete registration form
5. ✅ **User profile created in `users` table**

**Test Appointment Booking:**

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

Your app uses these main tables:

```sql
users              -- User profiles and authentication
├── family_members -- Family member profiles
├── appointments   -- All appointment bookings
├── recent_visits  -- Visit history
├── notifications  -- User notifications
└── activity_logs  -- User action tracking

clinics            -- Healthcare facilities
├── doctors        -- Doctor profiles and status
└── queue_status   -- Real-time queue management
```

## 🚀 What Happens in Demo Mode vs Connected Mode

### Demo Mode (Red indicator)
- Uses dummy data in memory
- Changes don't persist between sessions
- No real-time updates
- Perfect for testing UI/UX

### Connected Mode (Green indicator) 
- **All data saved to Supabase database**
- **Changes persist permanently**
- **Real-time updates across all devices**
- **Production-ready functionality**

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Demo Mode" Instead of "Connected"
**Problem:** Environment variables not loaded correctly
**Solution:** 
1. Check `.env.local` file exists in project root
2. Verify no extra spaces in variable values
3. Restart development server
4. Clear browser cache

### Database Errors During Operations
**Problem:** Database schema not set up
**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Run contents of `/lib/supabase-schema.sql`
3. Optionally run `/lib/sample-data.sql` for test data

### Authentication Failures
**Problem:** Auth providers not configured
**Solution:**
1. Supabase dashboard > Authentication > Settings
2. Enable Phone provider
3. For production: Configure Twilio credentials

## 📱 Production Readiness

Your app includes production-ready features:

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Users can only access their own data
